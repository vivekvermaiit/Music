# Music

This is an Android app that educates users about different genres of music that exist. Did you know that there are over 15 sub-genres of Metal alone? Thrash, Death, Black, Heavy, Power, Speed ...
There are apps that show songs similar to a particular song, but none that suggest and tell you about new stuff altogether.

You get a brief introduction about the genre of music and a youtube link to listen to a sample of that kind of music.
If you like it you can explore more of similar style of music :)

Technicalities:

Has two main activities. The landing page shows the user options to start exploring or to resume from where he/she left before.
This is done by storing the page on which the user currently is, in-memory.

The view page for a type of music works has objects passed into into to render. So there's a single xml page for the 6 types of music.

Installation Guide:

Clone the repository and run the app on Android Studio via and emulator or your actual phone.
