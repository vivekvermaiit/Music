    <string name="death_metal">Death Metal</string>
    <string name="death_metal_string">Death metal typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes. Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s.</string>

    <string name="thrash_metal">Thrash Metal</string>
    <string name="thrash_metal_string">Thrash metal is often regarded as the first form of extreme metal. It is generally characterized by its fast tempos, complexity and aggression. Thrash metal guitar playing is most notable for the "chugging" sound it creates through low-pitched palm muted riffs, and high-pitched shred guitar solos. Drummers often use double-kick and double-bass drumming. Vocals are most often shouted or sung in an aggressive manner. </string>

    <string name="heavy_metal_string">Also known as Traditional or Classic Metal, Heavy Metal is said to be the ancestor of all other genres of metal music. Rooted in 1980â€™s, Heavy Metal introduced big names like Judas Priest, Manowar and Iron Maiden. The first Heavy Metal bands use raging sounds and few lyrics. It is characterized by mid-to-fast-tempo riffs, by thumping basslines, crunchy riffs, extended lead guitar solos, and clean, often high-pitched vocals and anthemic choruses.</string>

    <string name="doom_metal">Doom Metal</string>
    <string name="doom_metal_string">Doom metal uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much "thicker" or "heavier" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath who are considered to be pioneers of metal. Ozzy Ozbourne, the lead vocalist, is also credit with inventing the "headbanging". </string>

    <string name="power_metal">Power Metal</string>
    <string name="power_metal_string">Power metal takes influence from heavy metal and speed metal, and often emphasizes clean, melodic, high-pitched vocals, and fast pacing that is mostly driven by double bass drumming and melodic lead guitar. The rhythm guitar is defined by straight power chord progressions. Sometimes, harsh vocals are used, but usually only as backing vocals. Lyrics usually involve fantasy themes. The songs often have a theatrical, emotionally "powerful" sound.</string>
